## About
[Frames](https://withframes.com) is an iOS and macOS app built for film photographers who want to keep their process organized. It lets you log camera, lens, film stock, and shooting details, then structure and archive each roll with clarity. When scans come back, Frames can reintegrate your notes as metadata, keeping your digital files tied to their analogue origin. Designed with a privacy-first mindset, Frames helps photographers preserve both their workflow and their creative history.

### The Problem of Lost Details
Film photography creates beautiful results, but many of the small details fade with time. Exposure settings, film types, and reflections are often forgotten, leaving negatives and scans without their story.

### How Frames Helps
Frames solves this by offering a dedicated space to record film data. Photographers can log film stocks, cameras, and settings, while also writing notes about mood, location, and inspiration.

### Preservation for the Future
These details can then be linked directly to your scanned photos, enriching them with metadata. This ensures your archive is not just a set of images but a resource that preserves your creative process.

### A Design That Lasts
Frames works across iPhone and Mac with a clean, distraction-free design. It emphasizes clarity and privacy, giving analog photographers a reliable companion for years to come.

### More Than an App
Frames is a way to protect and enhance your craft. By keeping your images connected with their context, it turns your archive into a living document of your photographic journey.
