## About
PromptGather.io transforms the way creators work with AI by acting as both an inspiration hub and a production powerhouse. Users explore real AI-generated videos and images to gather ideas, then craft their own outputs through built-in generators using simple text prompts. Whether you want to turn a written concept into a cinematic clip or edit an uploaded image for surreal or stylized effects, the platform bridges discovery and execution—and does it without requiring technical expertise.

## Features
- Prompt Library
The platform offers thousands of tagged prompts for both video and image models. These span cinematic, surreal realism, photorealistic styles, and more. Each prompt is paired with real visual examples—ranging from savanna journeys to neon cyberpunk scenes—helping users quickly find inspiration and apply ideas to their own projects.

- Video Explorer
Creators can browse more than 155 pages of short video clips (7–22 seconds), filtered by themes, motions, or tags such as Golden Hour and Slow Motion. It’s an effective way to spark ideas for adventure scenes, documentaries, or whimsical transformations, and users can easily copy prompts for their own generations.

- Image Explorer
The image gallery includes over 74 pages of vivid, community-shared visuals. Content can be filtered by elements like High Fashion, Dramatic Lighting, or Extreme Close-Up. It offers a fertile ground for discovering portrait styles, urban atmospheres, or hydro-punk concepts.

- AI Video Generator
The text-to-video tool uses Veo 3 models to produce professional-grade clips. Users can add reference images, select aspect ratios (16:9 or 9:16), and generate 1–2-minute visuals using prompts up to 2,000 characters. Each generation costs 60 credits, making it ideal for quick prototypes or polished social media videos.

AI Image Generator
This tool supports both text-to-image creation and image editing. Users can upload up to nine references, choose PNG or JPEG output, and receive results in 10–30 seconds. Each generation uses 5 credits and covers a wide range of styles—from minimalist elegance to vibrant cyberpunk—helping artists refine their creative visions effortlessly.
