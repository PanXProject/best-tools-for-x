## About
[PixExact](https://www.pixexact.com/) is an AI image generator and editor that creates visuals in exact pixel dimensions (up to 4096×4096), so your banners, thumbnails, and assets fit without cropping. Generate from text, transform a reference image, extend canvases with AI outpainting, remove backgrounds (including batch runs), and extract reusable prompts from images.

## Features
- Text-to-image with custom exact width/height and outputs up to 4096×4096
- Generate consistent images in multiple sizes from one prompt (multi-size generation)
- Image-to-image generation to transform an uploaded reference into new variations
- AI Image Extender (outpainting) to uncrop/expand images and extend scenes up to 4096px; bulk support
- Background remover with batch processing up to 20 images; output options include PNG/JPG/WebP
- Image-to-prompt generator with modes like Replication, Style, and General; useful for prompt refinement loops

## Use cases
- Marketing assets sized for specific placements (ads, banners, thumbnails) without manual resizing
- E-commerce workflows: fast product cutouts and bulk background removal
​- Social/content repurposing: uncrop and expand images to new aspect ratios
