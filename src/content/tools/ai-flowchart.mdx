## About
Instead of spending time dragging shapes and connecting every step manually, you can simply describe a workflow, paste a block of text, or start with a rough structure and let AI generate the first draft for you. From there, you can keep refining the diagram until it matches exactly what you need.

We built this for founders, product teams, operators, marketers, developers, and anyone who needs to explain a process visually without wasting time on diagram tools.

## Features

- Generate flowcharts from text
Turn prompts, notes, SOPs, or process descriptions into diagrams instantly.

- Fast editing and iteration
Refine the result quickly so your chart stays useful, not just pretty.

- Clear visual structure
Organize messy ideas into flows that are easier to understand and share.

- Useful for many workflows
Great for product planning, operations, onboarding, support flows, approval processes, decision trees, and more.

- Built for speed
Go from idea to visual flowchart much faster than starting from a blank canvas.
