## About
DitherImage.online is a high-performance web utility dedicated to the art of image dithering. While most online tools rely on server-side processing—causing frustrating delays—this platform leverages 100% client-side technology to provide true, zero-latency feedback.

Key Advantages:
## Features
- Feature 1
Zero-Friction Interaction: Users can instantly preview changes to algorithms (including Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, and Stucki) and color palettes. The real-time nature of the tool allows for rapid aesthetic experimentation.
- Feature 2
Guaranteed Data Privacy: By processing images entirely within the local browser environment, DitherImage.online ensures that sensitive visual assets never leave the user's device.
- Feature 3
Streamlined UX: The interface is stripped of bloat and advertisements, focusing solely on providing a fast, accessible, and high-quality dithering workflow for professional and hobbyist use alike.
