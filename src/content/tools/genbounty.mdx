## Overview

Genbounty is a comprehensive **AI Product Safety Testing Platform** with native EU AI Act compliance built in. Founded in London by Cindy Ogidi and Robert Morel, Genbounty delivers end-to-end AI product safety with a consumer safety first approach.

## About
**Our testing: We operate on a structured, per-project engagement model where teams of approved AI safety researchers are paid per project to conduct professional safety testing within defined scopes, timelines, and deliverables.**

The platform integrates team-based researcher testing with compliance documentation, continuous post-market monitoring, and incident-ready workflows to ensure AI systems ship safely for consumers.

## Core Mission

**"Find what your AI tries to hide, fix it fast, and keep you continuously compliant."**

Genbounty's mission is to bridge the gap between AI development and regulatory compliance by providing human-validated testing and automatic compliance documentation mapped to EU AI Act obligations.
